# pyxppgui

A Python GUI for XPP with graphical output with matplotlib.

The current plan is to roughly follow the layout of this excellent web-based xpp interface https://github.com/m1so/xpp-web

This program depends on XPPAuto (http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html, preferably version 8), xppcall (https://github.com/iprokin/Py_XPPCALL), python 2.7.6, matplotlib v1.3.1, and numpy v1.8.2.

This project is just for fun.

It is worth mentioning that there is another non-graphical wrapper to Python called XPPy, originally written by Jakub Nowacki https://github.com/jsnowacki/xppy, but examples are lacking. I have added some rudimentary examples in my fork here https://github.com/youngmp/xppy.
